                <h4>The Brief</h4>
                <h2>Sybil Resistant Identities</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello friend,
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am looking for a designer to help me bring an idea to life.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I've written a lot about sybil resistance and the upside for the web if sybil resistence is meaningfully created.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I would like to make a contribution to the advancement of sybil resistance, by creating a crypto economic game, 
                    wherein attackers are rewarded to forge identities on various sybil resistance protocols. At first it may seem crazy 
                    to offer a reward to attackers for breaking these tools, until you realize that the good that this reward can do —
                    it onboards more & more people onto sybil resistent identity platforms and it effectively creates a 'price of forgery' 
                    for each of these protocols. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    If HoneyPot.Money ran an active campaign that offered $10 to anyone who could claim a verified BrightID identity, and 
                    attackers did not manufacture thousands of BrightID identities, then one must logically assume that the cost of forgery 
                    for a BrightID identity is more than $10. This enables app builders to build new sybil-resistent games on top of these identity 
                    protocols on the trust assumption that the cost of forgery is at least $10.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Anyway, so here's what I'm thinking: HoneyPot.Money — A site where people can get paid to create sybil resistent identities, 
                    hardening sybil resistent identity systems by creating a known price of forgery.
                    <br/><br/>

                <h4>Discovery</h4>
                <h2>What is Sybil Resistance?</h2>
                <p>
                    Sybil resistance is the measure of a network's ability to defend itself against sybil attacks. A sybil attack involves the creation 
                    of multiple fake identities to maliciously influence and gain advantage over a network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might not be aware of it, but you've probably been exposed to sybil attacks or something similar: rigged giveaways where users submit multiple entries 
                    by using multiple emails, online voting systems with questionable voter identities, and even questionable social media 
                    engagement from users you can easily recognize as bots.
                </p>

            <div class="process-article-body span-widest">
                <h2>Decentralization and Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    What got me into the Web3 space was the promise it held for decentralization and privacy — where we get to control our own data and not
                    the giant companies that can't seem to stop themselves from profiting off of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the problem we're trying to solve, I had to dig deep and understand non-personhood approaches
                    to sybil resistance that goes beyond standard identity validation (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Project). Other known
                    methods are vouching systems from social trust graphs and economic costs which is known to deter the creation of fake identities but also puts 
                    some burden on good actors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've designed HoneyPot.Money to integrate with BrightID which is a privacy-first social identity network allowing users to be able to 
                    authenticate proof of identity without having to share their personal information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We designed the claim flow to be fairly straightforward. This made designing from zero to one easier and allowed me to focus on producing both illustrations 
                    and UI for the project.

                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <h2>Open Source Projects Collaboration</h2>
                <p>
                    As I've already worked on several projects with Gitcoin, I already had a solid idea of what to expect when it comes to collaboration. Just like most of the open-source projects I've previously 
                    worked on, there was no Developer on hand to work with right away. This meant preparing a comprehensive design documentation for developer hand-off is of absolute importance as it is highly 
                    likely that design and development will have a significant gap in timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made sure to prepare an outline and start writing snippets of design process while still in design mode. This helped streamline my design process and allowed me to focus on refinement
                    at the later stages of the process.
                </p>

                <h4>Task</h4>
                <h2>Visual Design</h2>
                <p> As the sole Designer for the project, I also took on the task to create the illustration and branding. After focusing on the Product Design side of things, this became a fun respite 
                    from data-driven and problem-based thinking. After some quick rough drafts, I met with Kevin to walk him through my design ideas and we ended up choosing an illustrative, storybook-like approach to 
                    the UI where users are represented by bear illustrations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I designed both the branding, illustrations and UI in Figma to streamline the process. Figma has a decent vector tool but I made sure to limit the elements into simpler shapes to avoid any problems
                    with complex svg exports and animations.

                <h4>Action</h4>
                <h2>Putting The Elements Together</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that all the elements are ready, I started preparing for designing the screens while also thinking about how they will be developed. I proposed an 
                    idea where some of the elements in the UI will be randomly generated and only appear at certain local machine time to simulate day and night. This also 
                    helps keep the screens fresh and fun to look at as different elements load each time and users will see different sets of illustrations depending on 
                    their local time. To push the design further, I decided to add animated svg elements that also randomly spawn and add more depth to each composition.

                <h2>High Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
                <p>
                    As there was still no available developer to collaborate with after finishing the designs, I spent some time creating prototypes of the different claim scenarios. I created a <a href="https://github.com/mlvein/HoneypotMoney_Design?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">Github 
                    repository ↗</a> so incoming developers can also easily fork the code and use it as a guide or even as a starting point for development even if I'm not available to walk them through my designs.

                <p>
                    A couple weeks after I finished designing the screens and documentation, some developers started to fork the repository and take a stab at the project. They were able to connect the backend with 
                    the designs I coded which shaved some time off front-end development. The project was eventually shelved as efforts where redirected to a Proof-of-Personhood integration on Gitcoin Grants named 
                    Gitcoin Passport.

                    Potential additional learning features about sybil attacks and sybil resistance can be introduced to the project, taking advantage of the storybook-like illustrations and fun approach which can be
                    conducive to teaching complex concepts in a fun way. I would love to get the chance to explore this idea further and make the experience more robust not just for users familiar with Web3 but also new
