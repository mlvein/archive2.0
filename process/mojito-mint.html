                    NFTs broke into the mainstream in 2021, disrupting industries and sparking the interest of those 
                    new to the Web3 space including established brands and businesses.
                <br/> <br/>
                    I joined Mojito to help design a platform that onboards organizations and their audience into Web3, 
                    easing friction for new users and unlocking possibilities with on-chain data that goes beyond
                    trading high-value digital tokens.

                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <h2>Designing from Zero to One</h2>
                <p>
                    The first version of Mint's MVP was one of my first projects after joining Mojito. I found out quickly that designing from zero 
                    to one with prior experience in Web3 wasn't as much of an advantage as the technology continued to advance at a rapid pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My design role for this project evolved at certain periods in the company — from early V1 contributor
                    to prioritizing other projects before coming fully back in for V2 eventually making design decisions, milestone developer hand-offs, 
                    testing, and onboarding incoming Designers into the project.

                <h2>Version 1 MVP</h2>
                <p>
                    While working on initial explorations we determined it was important for the team to get a good grasp of Web3 jargon and complex 
                    concepts such as token contracts and on-chain transactions to help inform our initial explorations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a Developer team who are experts in the space, we set up frequent learning Q&A meetings, asking questions about NFTs and
                    the blockchain which not only helped us get up to speed with developments in the space but also validated our assumptions on
                    designing initial user flows mainly focused on Developer user types responsible for crafting token contracts.
                </p>

            <div class="process-article-body span-widest">
                <p>
                    For Mint V1, we focused on designing for two user types: “Developers” familiar with the Web3 space,
                    mainly responsible for creating and minting tokens — and “Managers,” who are usually new to Web3 and whose responsibilities involve
                    preparing the minted items for sale and managing each sales when it goes live until it is delivered to the buyer's
                    wallet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My initial design explorations focused on Manager user types (Customer Managers and Content
                    Managers) that would use the Mint platform for the following tasks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting minted/imported tokens to set up for sale</li>
                    <li>Setting up the collection / marketplace</li>
                    <li>Managing sales</li>
                    <li>Managing bids for auction type sales</li>
                    <li>Managing customers</li>

                <h4>Task</h4>
                <h2>Mint V1 Design and Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Sotheby's, one of Mojito's first clients, helped shape the initial version of the product. During 
                    our discovery phase, they shared the internal tool they use to manage their items and sales which include their 
                    bidding mechanism. They were looking for its Web3 counterpart that will allow them to create digital items, 
                    mint them into the blockchain, and put them up for sale in their marketplace — Sotheby's Metaverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parts of V1, particularly the minting and item importing flows, where being actively developed while the rest of
                    the platform was still being designed. This gave us information as to what initial users thought of the platform and 
                    made discoveries on wasn't working well.
                </p>

            <div class="process-article-body span-widest">
                <h4>Another Challenge</h4>
                <h2>New Changes</h2>
                <p> As we continued to gather insights from V1 platform usage and building out the remaining parts of the product, we found that 
                    V1 of Mint ended up mostly being used internally, helping clients build their sales and marketplaces as they've found it still 
                    too complex to handle by themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were also met with big changes not just with product strategy, but as an organization. With a change in go-to-market strategy and scope, 
                    we reconsidered our approach to design and shifted back into discovery phase for what a V2 of the Mint platform would be.
                </p>

                <h4>Action</h4>
                <h2>Designing a Friendlier Platform</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Lead Designer spearheaded the redesign of V2 of Mint with the goal of making it less intimidating for non Web3 natives to 
                    accomplish tasks while also giving them access to the blockchain via the platform just like in V1. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most patterns used in Mint are borrowed from Web2 so users remain on familiar ground. Only when there is contract or blockchain 
                    interaction where the abstraction is lifted and they are taken into simplified wallet signing flows.

                    Now that contract creation has become more standard, Managers can easily craft their own collection and select not just standard 
                    contract types like limited edition 1-of-1s or ERC1155s but also craft redeemable collections and claimable sale types that further 
                    diversify the use case of NFTs.

                    Manager flows are mainly patterned to Web2 — allowing them to focus on creating sales (Drops) and managing listings (Items) in their storefronts 
                    (Marketplace) without having to worry about additional complexities such as smart contracts and wallet interactions

                <h4>Results</h4>
                <h2>Going Beyond Digital Tokens</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mint platform enabled our clients like Sotheby's to unlock growth in the Web3 space, earning more than $130M in sales through their successfully
                    launched in-platform Drops such as LFC, Tomokazu Matsuyama, and Sebastiao Salgado.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other clients also found success in their launched marketplaces and primary sales that went beyond trading digital tokens. Activations involving more than 
                    online NFT drops such as claimables integration during in-person events, redeemables as reward for being a supporter of their brand, and collectibles were 
                    just some of the creative use cases enabled by the platform.
                </p>

                    Version 2 of Mint became a more robust product that not only handles item management and delivery within the blockchain. Designing a bridge that 
                    allows the transition from Web2 to Web3 to become smoother unlocked opportunities not just for end-users but for Web2 businesses to explore different 
                    use-cases with NFTs that goes beyond trading (e.g. memberships, rewards, community management, and proof-of-ownership for real, physical goods)

                    To close the loop, we've designed a secondary marketplace as well as a site builder for the platform which I led. The site builder was initially
                    a part of V1 of Mint but was decided that API endpoints were enough for our Developer type users and they can choose to partner with external agencies to
                    create more custom drop experiences from them.

                    We designed the site builder and secondary marketplace to be a simple plug-and-play feature that our users can easily activate and launch without the 
                    need for set-up, given that they've already launched a drop.

                    Designing a platform involving new technologies that continue to evolve at a rapid pace is oftentimes challenging but definitely rewarding 
                    as it helps businesses and their users unlock growth in a new space. Just as much as we’ve relied on tried and tested Web2 patterns to to 
                    provide a familiar experience for users, balancing it with how it can be improved for Web3 was one of my key takeaways for this project.
